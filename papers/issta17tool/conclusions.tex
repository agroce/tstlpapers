\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

This paper presents a set of tools, part of the TSTL \cite{tstlsttt}
testing language and tool suite, for letting users make the most of the
tests the tool generates.  In addition to standard
replay, regression, and minimization, TSTL implements some powerful
new techniques from the recent literature for manipulating tests
\cite{OneTest,slippage}.

As future work, we plan to continue to develop TSTL's tools for
working with tests.  Some improvments are simple:  for instance, the TSTL
random tester currently provides simple fault localization over the
tests generated during a run (if there are any failures)
\cite{Tarantula}, but not for regression tests.  More importantly,
we plan to continue to use TSTL as a platform for experimenting with
and making available novel methods for making use of automatically
generated tests, including methods for composing and de-composing
tests and generating information from tests that can be used to guide
future testing.
