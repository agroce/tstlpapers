\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}

This paper reports on an end-user-driven automated testing effort for a Python
library used to automate Geographic Information System analysis and
data management.  The test system is based on the TSTL
\cite{NFM15,ISSTA15,tstl} domain-specific language for testing, which
enables a declarative style of test harness development, where the
focus is on defining the actions in valid tests, not determining
exactly how tests are generated.

The complexity, size, and some unusual features of
the SUT have driven some engineering decisions, enhancements to the
TSTL language, and new testing utilities.  This paper focuses on
presenting the experience of testing a large complex system, and (we
hope) demonstrates that a domain expert whose programming experience
consists almost entirely of using the Software Under Test can make use
of modern automated test generation methods to find faults in complex software systems.
